== Description ==
We Can Track is an affiliate data tracking, processing and integration software that attributes affiliate sales data to publishersâ€™ traffic data.
With We Can Track, affiliate publishers can finally integrate their sales data in the marketing tools they use.

Registration is free and you will be able to make use of a 30 days trial period once you connected network accounts.

By installing and enabling the We Can Track plugin, your affiliate links will automatically contain unique SubIDs that will be used to trace a sale back to the click it originated from.

Furthermore, the We Can Track plugin is compliant with most redirection (cloaking) plugins, making automatic SubID placements possible.

3. Upload the directory wecantrack in /wp-content/plugins/ (or install the plugin over the plugin manager of WordPress)

6. Before enabling the plugin, perform testing as explained in step 3 in this guide: https://wecantrack.com/wordpress/
7. If testing was unsuccessful please contact support@wecantrack.com.

9. Test again
10. Done :)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens if for some reason the We Can Track service goes down, will my links break? =
We have developed a fallback to the original link for these situations.

= Redirect/cloaking plugin seems to be not compliant with We Can Track? =
This is a rare occurrence, but it could happen if the redirect is being done on the client-side or if the redirect plugin is not using the Wordpress redirect function.
Not to worry, we'd be happy to help you. Just contact us at support@wecantrack.com with information about your redirection plugin and other relevant information and we'll check for possible solutions.
